# Comparison-Between-the-Neuronal-Network-and-the-Cosmic-Web
It has been hypothesized that neural systems show topological similarities with the cosmic web,
indicating common, or even universal, mechanisms or laws governing the formation of networks
across scales, from micrometers to megaparsecs. However, the statistical strength of such similarity
is not fully verified. In this project, we first process images from the human cortex, cerebellum, and
cosmic web to identify nodes. We sample links according to node distances from an exponential
function with exponents r0 suggested by previous work to obtain ensembles of network realizations
for each case. Then we compare them using various metrics, from shortest paths to spectral entropy.
Our results indicate that the systems are rather distinguishable.
